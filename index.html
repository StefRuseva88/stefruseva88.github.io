        <p>Welcome to my pet supplies store project! Let me share the story behind it. For years, I thrived in the tourism industry, a path ingrained in my family's history. Then, the unexpected hit: the COVID-19 pandemic halted everything. But I refused to halt alongside it. Instead, I delved deep into my core passions: nature and technology.

With a clear vision, harnessing my love for animals, nature, and positive energy, I launched my own pet store. It wasn't just about commerce, it was about connecting with what mattered most to me.

Assembling a dedicated team, we embarked on the creation of an e-commerce website. Our team included a developer, designer, salesperson, accountant, and a fulfillment company. But there was a missing piece: someone who can test everything...and that is how I found out about my relationship with testing.

Enter my newfound enthusiasm for software, a realm I had yet to explore. Despite being unfamiliar territory, I embraced the challenge wholeheartedly. This project became my initiation into the world of software testing, and I poured my heart into ensuring its success.

I'm thrilled to be part of this exciting new world of opportunities. If I have one regret, it's that I didn't start this journey sooner. But hey, better late than never, right?

Today, I look back at this like a testament to my determination, adaptability, and the power of pursuing one's passions.
